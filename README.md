# VBA-automation

If your organization is using an Excel-based control tracker, list, or matrix and 
manually updates leadsheets by copying the information over into each workpaper,
// here's a minimum-viable macro solution built using VBA code

I have highlighted the lines of code in the txt file that need to be reconfigured depending
on how you want to implement this. The ranges are hardcoded at the moment but those
can be replaced with FileDialog and InputBox options that provide a safe interface for a user to
interact with instead of fudging with the code
